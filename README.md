# ROS Project Template

Setting up a new ROS project often requires a significant amount of
preparation and boilerplate configuration, costing you valuable robot
development time ðŸ¤–. Recognizing this, we have put together this template
repository configured with a ROS development environment, continuous
integration, and more. This project is the result of much trial and error
across many projects, and we hope that this helps you save some effort in
setting up your own projects.

## Features

The main features of this template are:

- A development environment for Visual Studio Code including a [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
and configurations for linting and auto-formatting your code
- Docker images that support deployment to a variety of systems (e.g., arm64
systems)
- Continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions
- GitHub Issue and Pull Request templates

## Quick start

Using this template is as easy as 1, 2, 3...

1. Use this repository [as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
for your project
2. Replace all instances of "ros-template" with your own project's name and all
instances of "robotic-decision-making-lab" with your own user's name
3. Replace the source code with your own project!

Feel free to remove any unused configurations/pipelines and to adjust things as
you see fit for your project!
